## Introduction
Teammates are to come together and finalize a design to build. Then, they must create a SolidWorks model that resembles their design After creating a full sized model, they scale it down to create a 3/8 scaled model. Using the scaled model, they are to create a physical model of their mechanism using foam board, 1/4" x 1/4" sticks, dowels, springs, rubber bands, and 3-D printed parts. The scaled model should be able to propel a 4.4 oz., 3.25" x 3.25" Cornhole bag 11' - 3" into a 4" diameter goal.
